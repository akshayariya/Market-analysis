#Market Analysis , Prediction using LSTM

This repository contains code for analyzing historical stock market data and predicting future stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

Overview
The Stock Market Analysis and Prediction project aims to analyze historical stock market data, identify trends, and forecast future stock prices using deep learning techniques. The project utilizes LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), known for its effectiveness in capturing sequential patterns.

Features
Analyze historical stock market data to identify trends and patterns.
Utilize LSTM neural networks to predict future stock prices.
Visualize historical data, predicted trends, and model performance.

Usage
Data Preparation: Preprocess the historical stock market data (e.g., normalization, feature engineering). Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Train the LSTM model on the training data. Tune hyperparameters as necessary.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict future stock prices. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.
Visualization:Visualize historical stock market data, predicted trends, and model performance using appropriate plots and charts.

Dataset
Data set with historical price information for 3 high growth stocks and bitcoin from 2013 to 2023. Basic analysis of returns and visualizations included.
